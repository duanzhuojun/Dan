<h3>The Game Lite.</h3>
<p>You will be writing methods for a card game.&nbsp; For the purpose of the exam, you must write one class, Game. You will be writing two methods for this class.&nbsp; The Game consists of 8 total cards 2-9 and two discard piles up and down.&nbsp; You must try to discard all cards in your deck of 9 cards by placing them on one of the two discard piles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cards may be placed on pile 1 if they are greater in value than the value on top of pile 1.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cards may be placed on pile 2 if they are lower in value than the value on top of pile 2.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Pile 1 starts with the value 1 and Pile 2 starts with the value 10.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>You shuffle the deck then pull one card at a time and determine if you can play it on one of the piles.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<p>The first method you must write is a&nbsp;<strong>canPlay</strong>&nbsp;method to determine if the currently drawn &nbsp;card can be played.&nbsp; The second is a&nbsp;<strong>inDeck</strong> method that will determine if the given card value is in the given deck of 8 cards.&nbsp;The two methods,&nbsp;<strong>canPlay</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>inDeck</strong>, must be implemented in the class Game.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>canPlay&nbsp;</strong>method:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>canPlay&nbsp;</strong>method will take an 3 integer parameters the first the value of pile1, the second the value of pile2, and the third the card being drawn for play. You may assume that the values of pile1, 2 and the card are valid numbers.&nbsp; This method should return either a 0 if the card cannot be played on either pile, a 1 if the card can be played on pile 1, a 2 if the card can be played on pile2, or a 3 if the card can be played on either pile 1 or pile2.</li>
<li>For Example 1: Given a pile1 of 3 a pile2 of 5 and a card value of 4 you should return a 3 indicating it can be played on either pile. Example 2: pile1: 7, pile2: 2, and card: 5 should return 0 for not being playable on either pile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>inDeck</strong>&nbsp;method
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp;<strong>inDeck</strong>method will take two parameters. The first parameter will be the deck - &nbsp;an array of integers that is has 8 cards in it[number values 2-9].&nbsp; The second parameter will be an integer card value to see if this value is in the deck. &nbsp;&nbsp;You may assume that the card deck will be an array of 8 integers and not null.&nbsp;
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Your method should return the last index value of where the card is found(the deck may contain duplicates)&nbsp;<em>if it is found.</em></li>
<li><em>Your method should return a 9 &nbsp;if the value of the card is not found in the deck(the value of the card is still between 2 and 9 ).</em></li>
<li><em>Your method should return 10 if the value of the card is invalid(ie the card value is not between 2 and 9 in value).&nbsp;</em><em></em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For example:
<ul>
<li>For an array of {7,4, 5, 3, 2, 8, 9,6} and a card value of&nbsp;7 the method should return a 0(zero) as the 7 is located at index 0 for the array. Or if a value of 11 is passed for the previous array you should return a 10 for an invalid value to be checked.</li>
<li>For an array of {4, 7, 5, 3, 2, 7, 9, 6} and a card value of&nbsp;7 the method should return a 5 as the 7 is located at last index 5 for the array. Or if a value of 8 is passed to the method, you should return 9 for not finding the card value in the deck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
